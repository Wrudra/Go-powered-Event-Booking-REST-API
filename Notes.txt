* To accept and handle an incoming request, we could use the HTTP package, that's part of GO's standard library.
But I will use the Gin package, which is a third-party package provided for GO.

    "Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). 
    It features a Martini-like API with much better performance -- up to 40 times faster. 
    If you need smashing performance, get yourself some Gin."

    Before downloading the library, create a mod file 
    Run: go mod init root

    Download library: go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

    Lastly import
